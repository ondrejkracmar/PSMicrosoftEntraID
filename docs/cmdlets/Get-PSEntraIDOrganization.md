## NOTES

Piping into Select-Object -First N logs a warning that is not a failure:

    WARNING: [<cmdlet>] Failed to: ...
| The pipeline has been stopped

The results are correct and complete.
Select-Object stops the pipeline once it
has what it asked for, and the next write throws PipelineStoppedException -
normal termination, reported as an error only because the write happens inside a
protected block.
Materialise first if the warning is in the way:

    $items = @(<cmdlet> ...)
    $items | Select-Object -First 3

or filter server-side with -Filter instead of trimming client-side.
Not silenced
on purpose: the only fix that works is to collect the whole result before
emitting any of it, which would cost streaming on every read.
